## INTRODUCTION

- In this Repository I am going to create a AI model that can create songs and it will say it to you. You

- This is just a fun project I am doing.

- And also I want to learn about data analytics and preprocessing methods. So I will spend a few week on this project. This project will not be released until I am finished with this project. The start day is Dec 18 7:39PM.
- This project is really interesting and fascinating I have never done anything like this.
